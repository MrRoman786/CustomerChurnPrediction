# CustomerChurnPrediction
This Python script trains a logistic regression model to predict customer churn using a bank dataset. It preprocesses data by encoding categorical variables and scaling features, then splits it for training and testing. Finally, it evaluates model accuracy, predicts for a sample input, and computes the mean squared error.
